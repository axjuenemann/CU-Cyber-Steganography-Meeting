# 3. Bit Planes
Messages can be hidden in images in another way, in the color planes! This is common CTF challenge where the flag is hidden within plain site, but just hidding in another color plane. Additioanlly, the color planes can reveal hidden data by static at top of the file when flipping through the planes.

While stegsolve is a common tool for this, for the purpose of this meeting and saving install time, we are going to use [StegOnline ](https://georgeom.net/StegOnline/upload)

Simply upload the image, press "Browse Bit Planes" and start clicking through them!
