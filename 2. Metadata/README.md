# 2. Metadata
Metadata is data that describes other data. For example, if you take a picture on your phone, that photo has tons of metadata, including when it was taken, where it was taken, and what model of camera took it!

Conveniently, we can edit this data to hide our own messages!

The tool of choice for viewing this metadata is `exiftool`

**Important Commands:**

`exiftool file`: shows metadata of the passed in file

### Exercise 1 - Oh no Clippy! (Deadface CTF 2024)

### Exercise 2 - Isn't This Just Beatiful? (StegOnline)
